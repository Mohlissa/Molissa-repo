        <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool</h2>
        <p>
          I joined AltSchool because i needed a direction and guidance in the
          tech journey, i was doing much of self learning few months before i
          applied into AlrSchool but i only see myself going with no direction
          and i figured i needed guidance and also a platform where i can
          connect with like minded people, checking online i realized only
          AltSchool can help me with the road map into making my dreams come
          through and also they have the platform in which i need for
          networking.
